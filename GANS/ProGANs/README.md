# ProGAN
A clean, simple and readable implementation of ProGAN in PyTorch. I've tried to replicate the original paper as closely as possible, so if you read the paper the implementation should be pretty much identical. The results from this implementation I would say is close to the paper, but I did not train it to 1024x1024 images because I found it took too long. I also did not use number of channels = 512, but instead made the model smaller so that would be something that could worsen the results. I'll include some examples results below.
